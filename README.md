Docker (optional): For containerization

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository locally: git clone https://github.com/your-repo/wallet-service.git
cd wallet-service

2. Configure appsettings.json
In appsettings.json, youâ€™ll need to set up:
- Database Connection: Set the DefaultConnection to your SQL Server instance ;
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Your_SQL_Server_Connection_String"
}

    "Origins": {
    "AllowedSites": [ "https://production-site.com" ]
  },

3. Run Migrations (if using Entity Framework)
  -dotnet ef database update or Update-Database.
  -Build the Docker image: docker build -t wallet-service .


4. Running the Application :
   -dotnet run

5.Using Docker (Optional)
-To run the service in Docker:
 --Build the Docker image: docker build -t wallet-service .
 --Run the container: docker run -p 5000:5000 wallet-service.

 6. Accessing the API Documentation
Navigate to https://localhost:5001/swagger to view and interact with the API endpoints in Swagger.

7. Testing Authorization
